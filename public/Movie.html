<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Avatar Series</h3>
<p>This film series takes place on an alien planet and focuses the brutality of capitalist human society vs the more community centeres life of the natives to Pandora. The visual and vfx effects are absolutely striking.</p>

<h3>The Matrix Series</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite set of movies and has held its own with an intriguing story and captiviating action scenes. An all time classic.</p>

<h3>Rocky</h3>
<p>For all the fighters out there Rocky is a classic film that follows the rise of a failed boxer 'Rocky Balboa' through his struglle and training for the match of his life.<p>
